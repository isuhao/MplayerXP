MplayerXP dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently the project contains many codecs within of package.
But you should obtain additional codecs to have maximal performance:

libffmpeg.so
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please use the latest CVS version which can be obtained at
http://ffmpeg.sf.net

you should compile it in form of shared object:
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared=yes
make
make install

(But I suggest you to use snapshot of this package at 2002-03-15
which can be obtained on http://mplayerxp.sf.net)

libdivxdecore.so
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module is closed source project.
You can obtain it at:
http://www.divx.com

Please don't mix that with odivx project which have the same name
of shared object. This project is not supported by mplayerxp because
odivx format can be handled by many other competitors of Mayo product.
