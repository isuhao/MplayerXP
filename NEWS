Version 0.5.0

Most noticeable:
* Changed method of default A-V synchronization: mplayerxp now handles PTS-info
  for both audio and video streams to setup internal timers.
  (Has a lot of positive sides and introduces many bug-fixes and
  code simplification. This method is auto-convergitive from point
  of A-V synchronization. And so on and so on and so on... )
* increased number of simultaneously working threads upto 5
* Fixed frame-dropping
* increased max. number of buffers for decoding ahead upto 1024
* added loops to await of previous busmastering transfer completness.
* mplayerxp is able to provide any bitness of audio samples from codec
  to audio card to reach the best audio quality (mainly using alsa drivers).

Other:
* was implemented muxer (mainly for correct DVD dumping).
* stream and demuxer's levels were redesigned to be easy expandable.
* imported audio and video filters from mplayerhq
  * video filters were redesigned for slices.
  * implemented new ones.
* added new codecs from ffmpeg.
* cache2 was implemented as thread (instead of vfork)
* multiple imports from mplayerhq (include demuxers, codecs's interface, dmo, QT
  and other). Note: qtxsdk doesn't work in XP mode :(
* use sliced output for ffmpeg's codecs.
* Benchmark feature was redesigned to display human understandable numbers ;)
* Use official version of libdvdnav. Implemented seeking with libdvdnav
* postprocessing became an independent project as part of ffmpeg.
* keep aspect ratio on window_resize if -zoom key was specified
* VIDIX became an independent project (from its history):
  * fixed colorkey engine programing on radeons.
  * fixed system lookup during busmastering on many ATI Mach64 cards.
  * implemented busmastering for 3DLabs Permedia
  * expanded set of known Radeons.

Version 0.1.9
(Note: It's not scheduled release. It's collection of stable patches
from mplayerxp-CVS applied into mplayerxp-0.1.0. This release is still
supports 2 threads only. The release which will support upto 4 threads
is comming soon).

Version 0.1.0

* new dri based libvo interface
* picture viewer
* restored postprocessing with libmpeg2 and ffmpeg.
* UPDATED description of MplayerXP (see README)

* Fixed frame dropping algorithm! Now the project uses adaptive
  frame dropping in XP-mode
* restored screenshot facility
* Imported single threaded Arpi's core from mplayer-0.9-pre
* codec family selection changed: now you should specify name of family
  but not a number.

  reliable code + no dependencies at compile-time from installed
  libraries.
* Code cleanup:
   removed:
    - Gui
    - mencoer
    - non-GPL'ed code: g72, xa (I hope it's final cleaning)

   disabled:
    - dxr3 (currently it's buggy)

Version 0.0.0

* restructurizing
