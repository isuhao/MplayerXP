Compiling and installing under Win32!
=====================================
1. You need download and install Cygwin-1.5+ package which can
   be obtained at http://www.cygwin.com/.
   You may enter Cygwin's shell with using this .cmd script:
	@ECHO OFF
	SET TERM=UNIX
	SET MODE=UNIX
	SET MAKE_MODE=UNIX
	SET PATH=C:\PATH_WHERE_CYGWIN_WAS_INSTALLED\usr\bin;%PATH%
	SET CYGWIN=E:\usr
	SET HOMEDRIVE=E:\usr
	umount --remove-all-mounts
	mount C:/PATH_WHERE_CYGWIN_WAS_INSTALLED /
	bash
	exit
2. You need download and install SDL package which can be obtained at
   http://www.libsdl.org
   Note: with cygwin you don't need to have libSDL.a. Linking
   may be performed with non-stripped SDL.dll which sould be
   located in directory described in PATH environment variable.
